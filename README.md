# text-serial-dedupe
deduplication script that tries to assume whether data is duplicated, how much and tries to remove it

# why script is not written in modern javascript?
script doesn't focus on new standards as it was written for planetpress tooling, where we currently
has some sort of pseudo es6 - has let, but not const etc.
